To manage and install mods for a game, a software or a destination 
folder, you have to add a config in the OvGME management list. To 
create a new configuration you can click on the "<b>New</b>" 
button or go to the "<b>Config</b>" menu then select "<b>New...</b>". 
A new dialog window will prompts you to specify informations about 
the new  configuration to create. 
    
    <blockquote> 
      <b>Configuration title</b><br>
      This is the main identifier for management list entry. This title
      can be what you want and can be modified later.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Configuration root folder</b><br>
      This must be the path to the folder where mods will be installed 
      when applyed. This is usually the game or software installation 
      folder.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Configuration mods folder</b><br>
      This must be the path to an existing folder where mods are stored, 
      this is where OvGME will seek for available mods for this 
      configuration.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Custom configuration backup folder</b><br>
      If the option is checked, this must be a valid empty folder where 
      backup data will be stored.<br>
      If the option is not checked, the default OvGME backup location 
      will be used.<br>
    </blockquote>
    
To activate a configuration you just have to select the desired 
entry in the management list combo box. Once you activated a 
configuration, the mods folder and backup folder are analyzed 
to gather available mods for installation or restoration.
