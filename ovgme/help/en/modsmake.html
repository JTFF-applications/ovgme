OvGME provides a tool to create a valid Mod-Archive (zip) from an existing 
Directory-Mod. The Directory-Mod have to be already well structured according the 
compatible mod structure described into the <a href="structintro.html">Mod structure</a> chapter.<br> 

<h4>From main menu</h4>
Go to the "<b>Mods</b>" menu then select 
"<b>Make Mod-Archive...</b>". The proper dialog will appear.<br>
<br> 

<h4>From Quick Pop-Up</h4>
Select a Directory-Mod you want to convert into Mod-Archive in the
mods list, then click on mouse right button. In the pop-up menu, select 
"<b>Make Mod-Archive...</b>".<br>

<blockquote>
<b>Directory-Mod root folder</b><br> 
This must be the path to the Directory-Mod folder to add to zip archive. 
This folder must be the one that contain the destination root (root path) 
file tree mirror with modified files.<br>
<br> 
<b>Destination path for Zip file</b><br> 
This the path to folder where the Mod-Archive Zip file will be created.<br>
<br> 
<b>Version for this mod</b><br> 
This is the version of the mod to be defined for this release. This 
value is used by the repositories. The version string will be added as 
version.txt file in the root of the Mod-Archive.<br>
<br> 
<b>Description / Readme for this mod</b><br> 
This is the optional description for the mod. If the description is not 
empty, a proper .txt file will be added in the root of the Mod-Archive, 
this .txt file will be automatically recognized as mod description 
by OvGME.<br>
<br> 
<b>Zip compression level</b><br> 
This is the zip compression method to be used to create the Mod-Archive.<br>
<br> 
</blockquote>

Once you entered the proper values, you can click on the "<b>Make</b>" button to begin
the creation process. The creation process can be canceled at any time.<br><br>  

<i>Note: If your mod contain many heavy files, this process can take awhile
since it compress all files in Zip format.</i>
