OvGME allow you to configure distant mods repositories to check for mods download or 
update. This chapter will deals only with the client side repositories feature. If you 
want to host and manage a repository, please see the Repository management chapter.<br><br>

Mods repositories are distant web servers that provide mods for download or update. These 
web servers must be OvGME compliant to be recognized during the repositories query.<br><br>

<i>Note: the repositories are provided by a third-party, OvGME does not  provide default 
repository (see Repository management).</i><br>

<h4>Configuring repositories</h4>

To configure distant repositories for the current configuration, go to the "<b>Mods</b>" menu, 
select "<b>Repositories</b>" then "<b>Configure...</b>". It will opens you a new dialog 
to manage repositories URL.<br>

<i>Note: The repositories list is not global, each configuration has its own repositories 
list. If you configured repositories for a config, this list is only valid for the current 
selected config.</i>

<h5>Adding or removing URL</h5>
To add a new repository URL into the list, fill the URL entry and click the "<b>Add</b>" 
button.The URL must be a valid URL to an HTTP server. Here is some examples of valid 
URL format:
<blockquote>
"<i>http://www.example.com/repos</i>"<br>
"<i>www.example.com:8080/repository/dcs</i>"<br>
"<i>http://192.168.0.1:80/mods</i>"<br>
</blockquote>

To remove a repository URL from the list, select the desired URL in the list, then 
click on the "<b>Remove</b>" button. 

<h5>Enabling or disabling URL</h5>

Repositories can be enabled or disabled for querying. A disabled repository will not be 
checked during repositories query, but will still available in the list for future usage.
<br>
To enable or disable repository URL simply check or uncheck the checkbox corresponding 
to the URL in the list.

<h4>Querying repositories</h4>

By querying repositories, OvGME will interrogate each enabled configured repository URL 
to create the list of available mods for update or download. To query repositories, go 
to the "<b>Mods</b>" menu, select "<b>Repositories</b>" then "<b>Query...</b>". It will 
opens you a new dialog.<br><br>

OvGME will automatically starts the interrogation process. Once the querying is 
finished, and if it succeed, some mods should appear in the list. Each entry is 
identified by an icon which describes its status relative to your local mods folder for 
this configuration.
<blockquote>
<img src="repos_available.png" alt="Mod Available">: Means that the mod is not present in your local mods folder and can be downloaded.<br>
<img src="repos_uptodate.png" alt="Mod Up To Date">: Means that the mod is already present in your local mods folder and has the same version.<br>
<img src="repos_upgrade.png" alt="Mod Upgrade">: Means that the mod is already present in your local mods folder but has a lower version than the one available in the repositories (you can upgrade the mod).<br>
<img src="repos_dngrade.png" alt="Mod Downgrade">:  Means that the mod is already present in your local mods folder but has a greater version than the one available in the repositories (if you download this mod, it will downgrade your local mod).<br>
</blockquote>
<h5>Downloading Mods</h5>
To download mods from repositories, you can simply doube-click on the desired mod in the 
list. You also can select several mods, then click the "<b>Download selected</b>" button. 
Finally, you can synchronize all your local mods folder by clicking on the 
"<b>Download all</b>" button.<br><br>

Downloading mods has several status depending the installation stage.

<b>Disabling old...</b> : Means that the current local mod is in uninstalling process. Indeed, a mod must be disabled in order to be upgraded or downgraded.<br>
