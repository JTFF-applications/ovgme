<h4>Does OvGME supports HTTPS servers ?</h4>
No. OvGME only supports the standard HTTP protocol.<br><br>

<h4>Can we have several repositories on the same server (web site) ?</h4>
Yes. OvGME only look at XML files at given URL and don't care about the web server, so 
you can host as many XML files as you want in the same place. For example, if you want 
to host repositories for several softwares or several mods lists, you can provide an XML 
file for each:
<blockquote><i>
     http://www.example.com/main (.xml)<br>
     http://www.example.com/updates (.xml)<br>
     http://www.example.com/special (.xml)<br>
     etc..
</i>
</blockquote>

<h4>Does OvGME supports dynamically generated XML data (PHP / ASP pages) ?</h4>
Yes. OvGME can gather XML data from any dynamically generated web page such as PHP or 
ASP page since the 1.6 version, but the provided repository URL must be explicit. Please 
see the Repository principle for more details.<br><br>


<h4>Does the repository server also must host the Mod-Archive zip files ?</h4>
No, as you can read in the Repository XML file chapter, the mod(s) URL provided in the 
XML is totally independent from the repository URL. The repository server only provide 
the XML "database" file. The Mod-Archive zip files can be located and downloadable on 
any other web address.<br><br>

<h4>Does OvGME supports download/update for mods that are not zip archives ?</h4>
Not at this time. OvGME will look only for zip Mod-Archives. During the repositories 
process (name check, version comparison, etc..) the classical Directory-Mods are simply 
ignored. So to say, the classical Directory-Mod support is more or less destined to 
become only a feature for mods makers, to help mods development (since an uncompressed 
folder structure is easier to modify than a zip archive).<br><br>

<h4>Can we use repositories mechanisms inside a local network ?</h4>
Yes, OvGME acts as a (very) simple raw HTTP client (web browser). You only need to have 
an HTTP server in your local network. If your local network does not provide domain 
name service (which is often the case), you only have to enter the IP-URL to the server 
as repository URL, for example: "<i>http://192.168.0.5/repository/main</i>"<br><br>

<h4>Does the distant Zip file to download must have the exact same name as the mod name specified in the XML file ?</h4>
No. OvGME don't care about the downloaded file name, once downloaded, the file will be 
renamed according the specified name with the "<i>.zip</i>" extension. For example, if in the 
XML file, the specified mod name is "<i>My Super Mod</i>" and the download URL is 
"<i>http://www.ex.net/super-mod-v1_0.zip</i>", the downloaded file will be renamed in 
"<i>My Super Mod.zip</i>" and will appear as zip Mod-Archive named "<i>My Super Mod</i>" in the 
mods list.
