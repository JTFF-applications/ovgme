To compare an existing snapshot for the current configuration, go to the "<b>Config</b>" menu, 
select "<b>snapshot</b>" then "<b>compare...</b>". A new dialog will prompt you to begin 
the comparison process. The comparison process can take long time since it must read all 
files to verify the xxHash checksum, you can cancel the comparison process at 
any time.<br><br>

<h4>Comparison output</h4>
During the comparison process, an output log is generated in the comparison process 
dialog window. This output log lists all file tree differences with the last snapshot. 
This list has three columns: Type, Change and Path.<br><br>

<blockquote> 
  <b>Type</b> : identifies whether the concerned entry is a file or a directory.
  <blockquote> 
    <span style="font-family:Courier;"><b>(f)</b></span> : stands for File.<br>
    <span style="font-family:Courier;"><b>(d)</b></span> : stands for Directory.
