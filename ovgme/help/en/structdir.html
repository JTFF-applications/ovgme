  <body style="font-family:arial; font-size:10pt;">
    <table bgcolor="#000" border="0" width="100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td style="color:#fff; font-size:14pt;">

A Directory-Mod must be a folder which contain the file tree with sub-folders that 
mirror the root folder files and sub-folders hierarchy. This 
folder must be placed in the mods folder, OvGME will take it as the 
mod contner-folder.<br> 
<br> 
Obviously, a Directory-Mod does not have to include all file tree, folders and 
sub-folder of the targeted root folder. Only the needed ones to respect the root 
folder file tree comparison between already existing files and modified files 
should be added. However, a mod can also include files or folders that does not 
already exists in the root folder file tree, they will be added as new files or folders 
(then deleted once the mod is disabled).<br> 
<br>
For example, if the destination root file tree is the following:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>
<span style="font-family:Courier;">
&#x1f4c1; MyGame<br>
&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c1; Textures<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c1; Landscape<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c4; picture1.dds<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c4; picture2.dds<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c1; Vehicles<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c4; picture1.dds<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c4; picture2.dds<br>
</span>
</blockquote>
And if your mod consist of changing some .dds texture files in 
"<i>MyGame\Textures\Vehicles</i>" your Directory-Mod folder should be structured as 
follow:
<blockquote>
<span style="font-family:Courier;">
&#x1f4c1; My Texture Mod<br>
&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c1; Textures<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c1; Vehicles<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c4; picture1.dds<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c4; picture2.dds<br>
</span>
</blockquote>
Then, the contner-folder "My Texture Mod" must be copied in the mods folder of 
this configuration te be recognized as a valid Directory-Mod.<br>
<br>
<i>Note: The Directory-Mod root folder should not contain files that are not intented to be
copied into the root folder file tree, such as readme.txt file or any other extra file, since
OvGME will considering them as part of the mod, then, copying them into the root folder
file tree.</i>
