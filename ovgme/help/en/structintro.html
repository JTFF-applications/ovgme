OvGME works by copying (either by replacing or adding) mod file tree into the root 
folder file tree. To be correctly accomplished, the mod file tree 
must have a specific structure. Indeed, OvGME does not uses file database to know 
which modifications a mod should apply to a root folder file tree. 
The database, is the mod file tree itself.<br>
<br>
For this reason, a mod should mirror the exact file tree (folders hierarchy) already 
present in the destination root folder, so OvGME can deduct what files are to be replaced, 
added, and saved as backup.<br>
<br>
OvGME supports two mod structure. The Directory-Mod, which is a simple contner-folder, and 
the Mod-Archives, which is a zipped version of a Directory-Mod. The Mod-Archives 
structure allows some extra features such as mod versioning and descriptions.
