OvGME supports versioning for Mod-Archives (not for Directory-Mod). The mod version is 
identified localy by a string contained in a specific text file at root of the 
Mod-Archive zip file, or by the repository provided data. This version is used by the 
repositories mechanism to check which version of a same mod is greater than another.

<h4>The version.txt file</h4>

OvGME automatically checks if a properly named "version.txt" file exists at root of 
the zip file of a Mod-Archive. If this file exists, it will be considered as the version 
string for this mod. This file must be a standard ASCII .txt file and the version string 
should follow the format as described below.

<h4>Version string format</h4>

The version string must be only numbers optionally separated by dot, no letter nor any 
other special character are allowed.<br>
<br>
There are up to three version components allowed, all separated by one (and only one) 
dot, to fit the standard GNU version numbering scheme as follow:<br> 
<span style="font-family:Courier;">
<i>major</i><b>.</b><i>minor</i><b>.</b><i>revision</i><br>
</span>
<br>

A valid version string does not have to include the three version components, it can 
for example include only <i>version major</i> and <i>version minor</i> components, 
or even only one number which will be considered as the <i>version major</i> component.<br> 
Here are examples of valid version string:<br>
<blockquote>
<span style="font-family:Courier;">
1.5.0<br>
1.2<br>
2<br>
0.9.5<br>
0.9<br>
</span>
</blockquote>

The string parsing rules are the following: <br>
<ul>
<li>
If there are three numbers, each number is sequentially interpreted as:<br> <i>version major</i> . <i>version minor</i> . <i>version revsion</i><br>
</li>
<li>
If there are two numbers, each number is sequentially interpreted as:<br> <i>version major</i> . <i>version minor</i><br>
</li>
<li>
If there is only one number, the number is interpreted as:<br> <i>version major</i><br>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Version comparison</h4>

OvGME automatically determines which version is greater by analyzing the major, minor 
and revision components in order. If two version strings does not have the same format, 
it uses the following rule to compare them: The missing components at the right of 
the <i>version major</i> component has a <b>0</b> value.<br><br>
For example, a version string "<i>1.2</i>" is in fact numerically translated as 
<span style="font-family:Courier;">1.2.0</span> and a "<i>2</i>" string is numerically 
translated as <span style="font-family:Courier;">2.0.0</span>. So:<br>
<blockquote>
if the "<i>1.2</i>" string (<span style="font-family:Courier;">1.2.0</span>) must be compared to the "<i>1.2.1</i>" string, the "<i>1.2.1</i>" string will be considered as the greater one.<br><br>
If the "<i>1.2.2</i>" string must be compared to the "<i>1.3</i>" string, the "<i>1.3</i>" string (<span style="font-family:Courier;">1.3.0</span>) will be considered as the greater one.<br><br>
If the "<i>1</i>" string must be compared to the "<i>0.5.5</i>" string, the "<i>1</i>" string (<span style="font-family:Courier;">1.0.0</span>) will be considered as the greater one.<br><br>
