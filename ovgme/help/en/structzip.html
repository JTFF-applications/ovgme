The Mod-Archive is, so to say, only a zipped version of a valid Directory-Mod. However, 
because OvGME needs to correctly align mod file tree with root folder 
file tree and deduct where to seek for data, a valid Mod-Archive must follow some 
simple rules. If these rules are not respected, the zip file will not be seen as Mod-Archive.<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
  <b>The zip file <u>MUST</u> be compressed in ZIP format.</b><br>
  For now, OvGME only supports compressed file in standard ZIP format.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
  <b>The zip file <u>MUST</u> contain a properly named contner-folder at its root.</b><br>
  The zip archive root must contain the contner-folder (and <b>not</b> directly the 
  mod files). Also, this folder must have the same name as the archive itself but 
  without the .zip extension. For example, if you have a mod archive named 
  "<i>My Super Mod.zip</i>", it must contain the contner-folder named "<i>My Super Mod</i>" 
  where mod files are stored. This is because OvGME can't guess which folder into the 
  zip archive must be considered as the root folder and because Mod-Archives can include 
  some other files than only the modified root folder files, it seek for a 
  folder named exactly according the zip file name itself. This is a convention.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
  <b>The zip file can optionally contain a description file.</b><br>
  OvGME automatically checks if a properly named .txt file exists at root of the zip 
  file. If this .txt file is named "description.txt", "readme.txt" or has the same exact 
  name as the mod root folder or zip file itself (but with .txt extension instead of 
  .zip extension), it will take it as the mod description. This file must be a standard 
  ASCII .txt file, OvGME does not currently support rich format.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
  <b>The zip file can optionally contain a version file.</b><br>
  OvGME automatically checks if a properly named "version.txt" file exists at root of 
  the zip file. If this file exists, it will be considered as the version string for 
  this mod. This file must be a standard ASCII .txt file and the version string should 
  follow the format as described in the mod versioning chapter.<br><br>
</li>
</ul>
For example, if the destination root file tree is the following:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>
<span style="font-family:Courier;">
&#x1f4c1; MyGame<br>
&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c1; Textures<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c1; Landscape<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c4; picture1.dds<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c4; picture2.dds<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c1; Vehicles<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c4; picture1.dds<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c4; picture2.dds<br>
</span>
</blockquote>
And if your mod consist of changing some .dds texture files in 
"<i>MyGame\Textures\Vehicles</i>" your Mod-Archive zip file should be structured as 
follow:
<blockquote>
<span style="font-family:Courier;">
&#x1f4c2; My Texture Mod.zip<br>
{<br>
&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c4; README.txt <i>(optional)</i><br>
&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c4; VERSION.txt <i>(optional)</i><br>
&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c1; My Texture Mod<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c1; Textures<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c1; Vehicles<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c4; picture1.dds<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &#x1f4c4; picture2.dds<br>
}
</span>
</blockquote>
Then, the "<i>My Texture Mod.zip</i>" file must be copier in the mods folder for 
this configuration or imported using the import function.<br>
<br>
<i>Note: To create a Mod-Archive, you also can use the tool provided by OvGME, which 
generates for you the correct zip file with proper structure from an existing 
Directory-Mod folder (See the <a href="modsmake.html">Mods creation</a> chapter).</i>
